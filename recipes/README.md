Axon is a lightweight framework that helps developers build scalable and
extensible applications by addressing these concerns directly in the
architecture. This cookbook will provide you with recipes to implement
the Axon Framework. The recipes vary from basic recipes of Axon based
applications (setup, testing, upcasting, etc.) to specific advanced use
cases (distributed command bus, parameter resolvers, etc.).

The recipes are sorted on milestones versions of the Axon Framework. If
a recipe is not yet available for your version, please check another
version first, most of the implementation should overlap. If that recipe
covers not enough, or too much has changed on the topic, please [contact
us](https://axoniq.io/).

The recipes are a guideline on how you can use the Axon Framework. The
[reference guide](https://docs.axonframework.org/) explains the concepts
of the framework.
